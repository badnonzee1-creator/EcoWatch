# 🌍 EcoWatch: Blockchain-Powered Environmental Reporting

Welcome to EcoWatch, a decentralized platform that empowers communities to report and combat environmental threats like deforestation, pollution, and illegal wildlife trade on a global scale! Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, users earn token incentives for submitting verified reports, turning crowdsourced data into actionable insights for conservation. This solves the real-world problem of inadequate monitoring in remote areas by leveraging blockchain for transparent, tamper-proof reporting and rewards.

## ✨ Features

🌳 Community-driven reporting of threats with geolocation data  
💰 Token rewards (ECO tokens) for validated submissions  
🗳️ Decentralized verification by staked validators  
📊 Immutable global threat map for real-time tracking  
🛡️ Reputation system to prevent spam and build trust  
🏆 Bounty pools for high-priority environmental hotspots  
🔒 Governance DAO for community-driven updates and fund allocation  
📈 Analytics for stakeholders to query threat trends  

## 🛠 How It Works

EcoWatch uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle everything from token minting to report verification. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **ECO Token Contract** (Fungible token via SIP-10): Manages the ECO governance and reward token, including minting, burning, and transfers.  
2. **User Registry Contract**: Registers users with profiles, tracks reputation scores based on report accuracy, and handles staking for validators.  
3. **Report Submission Contract**: Allows users to submit threats with details like description, geolocation (lat/long), evidence hash (e.g., photo IPFS link), and threat type (e.g., deforestation).  
4. **Verification Pool Contract**: Routes reports to a pool of staked validators for voting; requires consensus (e.g., 3/5 validators) to approve.  
5. **Reward Distributor Contract**: Automatically distributes ECO tokens from a reward pool to reporters and validators upon successful verification.  
6. **Bounty Manager Contract**: Enables creation of targeted bounties (e.g., for Amazon deforestation) funded by donations, with extra rewards for reports in those areas.  
7. **Threat Map Storage Contract**: Stores verified reports in a geospatial index (using Clarity maps for lat/long bucketing) for querying global threats.  
8. **Governance DAO Contract**: Allows ECO token holders to propose and vote on changes, like adjusting reward rates or adding new threat categories.

**For Reporters**  
- Register your profile via the User Registry Contract.  
- Submit a report using the Report Submission Contract: Provide threat details, geolocation, and evidence hash.  
- If verified, earn ECO tokens automatically from the Reward Distributor—plus bonuses if it's in a bounty zone!  

**For Validators**  
- Stake ECO tokens in the User Registry to join the verification pool.  
- Vote on pending reports via the Verification Pool Contract.  
- Earn rewards for accurate validations; lose stake for malicious behavior.  

**For Viewers/Analysts**  
- Query the Threat Map Storage Contract to fetch reports by location or type.  
- Use off-chain tools (e.g., a web dApp) to visualize data on global maps.  

**For Governors**  
- Hold ECO tokens and participate in DAO votes through the Governance DAO Contract to shape the platform's future.  

Get started by deploying these contracts on Stacks testnet, connecting a wallet, and building a frontend to interact with them. Let's save the planet, one block at a time!
